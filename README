Utility to format Erlang code.  Reads source code on stdin and sends
formatted output to stdout.

    Warning! 
    
    This utility deletes any comments that are not before the start
    of an Erlang form.  So comments before a function should be
    preserved, but any comments inside the function body will be
    deleted.
